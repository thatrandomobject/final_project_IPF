**# INTERNATIONAL OPEN POWERLIFTING RATINGS ANALYSIS**

**## Details**

**# Created by: Linas Vaičiūnas and Rita Masionė**

This is the final project by students for Vilnius Coding School.
Project theme: Sport Competition Analysis.

This project is designed to collect data (Web Scraping), analyse and visualize data for International Open  Weightlifting Sport competitions by IPF in order to identify trends in the activities of the athletes grouped by gender, age, countries, and to perform comparative analysis over time - 5 years time frame (2018-2023)
Python language in PyCharm environment, CSV files and Database (PostgreSQL) were used as tools.

**## Summary of Key Findings**

  We found it interesting to group the individuals by gender and to see how their Relative Strength (RS) changes over chosen time (5 yrs.).  Where RS refers to the amount of force/ power a person can generate in relation to their body weight (Relative Strength Ratio=Total Strength/ Body Weight) and illustrates sports person’s efficiency and progress in a more objective manner. The first 2 linear graphs illustrates that in time the RS grows almost gradually in both groups, and the difference between male and female groups is not that big. We could state that the efficiency of the individuals in Weightlifting sport is increasing over time.

  The 3rd and 4th graphs support the outcome of the first 2 linear graphs. Total strength (combined amount of weight lifted by a powerlifter across three specific lifts: Squat, Bench, and Deadlift) seems to also grow gradually  in male and female groups over chosen time period. Which results that efficiency of powerlifters in both gender groups grows grow due to growing total strength.

  Further we chose to count all the powerlifters who were active in competitions in the same chosen time frame of 5 sequent yrs.. It was interesting to observe a quite sharp drop down in 2020 and 2022. COVID pandemic obviously influenced the results of 2020. We decided to check our hypothesis for 2022 by looking into the count of the powerlifters across the countries (Map Graph No. 6), and the results showed that number of active powerlifters dropped down in Ukraine and Russia, when normally the numbers of individuals in mentioned countries are high. Data confirmed that the results of 2022 were affected by the war in Ukraine. 

  Graphs No. 7, No. 8, and No. 9 are about interesting facts to know: 

  The average age is higher in females’ group then in men’s over the comparative time period of 5 sequent yrs (No. 7).
  
  The average of Total Strength among different age groups of the powerlifters across three specific lifts (Squat, Bench, and Deadlift). Data from 2023 suggests (No. 8). Are you up for Deadlift in your age group?
  
  Where the strongest powerlifters live? Bar Graph No. 9 with TOP 5 Countries to look into based on data from 2023.
